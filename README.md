# Breakout-Ball-Game 

Objective 

Java is widely used by game development companies and for creating mobile games. And this fact shouldn't come as much of a surprise, given how versatile the language is and given its rich collection of open-source material. Many of the world's top mobile games have been developed in Java. Minecraft, Mission Impossible III, and Asphalt 6 are just a few popular games which have been developed in Java. Here, I created a game using Java concepts like AWT, Swing etc.

Project Context
Breakout Ball game is a widely used game which was developed in the 1970s. In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all. A ball moves straight around the screen, bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen; to prevent this from happening, the player has a horizontally movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play. The player uses the platform to keep the ball running. The goal is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your platform. The project makes use of Java swing, OOPS concepts.I used new java concepts of beginner level (AWT, Swing, JFrame, JPanel etc). 

Project Stages
The product Architecture can be divided into 5 stages as follows:
1.Create a Java project using Command Line App.
2.Design the project structure.
3.Once the project is set, design the window terminal frame.
4.Design the entire background by setting the dimensions, colour, focus and object count.
5.Implement the actions of the keys and the objects.

High-Level Approach
1.Design the window where the game needs to be framed.
2.Design the entire gameplay (background, bricks, ball, paddle).
3.Implement the actions of the keys (to move the paddle sideways).
4.Implement the action performed by the ball on the bricks and paddle.

Primary goals
1.The player should be able to start the game in the terminal by pressing the ENTER key.
2.The player should be able to move the paddle sideways using the Leftwards and the Rightwards Arrow on the keyboard.
3.Once the player loses the ball, i.e. when the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.
4.Breaking each brick should provide the player a certain number of points. Let's say each brick contains 5 points, if a player breaks 10 such bricks, he gets 50 points.
5.Once the game ends, the terminal will present the final score of the player and give him the option to restart the game again.
